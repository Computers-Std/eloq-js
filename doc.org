* Object Oriented Programming

- Abstraction :: To simplify reality and focus only on the data and
  processes relevant to the application being built

- Encapsulation :: Data and the programs that manipulate those data
  are bound together and their complexity is hidden

- Inheritance :: A class can derive methods and properties from
  another class, resulting in a hierarchy of classes

- Polymorphism :: Different subclasses of the same superclass, can
  implement their shared interface in different ways
